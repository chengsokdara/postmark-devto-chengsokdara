    This path defines a 4-pointed star with curved (concave) sides.
    The shape is created by four quadratic Bézier curves.

    Coordinates:
    ViewBox is 0 0 100 100.
    Center of the viewBox is (50,50).

    Tip Points of the Star:
    N (North): (50, 5)
    E (East):  (95, 50)
    S (South): (50, 95)
    W (West):  (5, 50)

    Control Point for all curves:
    C (Center): (50, 50)
    Using the center as the control point for each quadratic Bézier curve
    pulls the curve inwards, creating the concave effect.

    Path Breakdown:
    M 50 5           - Move to North tip (N)
    Q 50 50, 95 50   - Quadratic Bézier curve from N to East tip (E), with control point C
    Q 50 50, 50 95   - Quadratic Bézier curve from E to South tip (S), with control point C
    Q 50 50, 5 50    - Quadratic Bézier curve from S to West tip (W), with control point C
    Q 50 50, 50 5    - Quadratic Bézier curve from W back to North tip (N), with control point C
    Z                - Close the path
